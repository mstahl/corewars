How's everybody doing?

This project's finally gotten to that magical point where it kind of needs a 
website or something where I can keep track of my progress on it, and communicate
how many of the features and things are implemented, what the plan is, all kinds
of other crap.

I started this project because I got bored one weekend and I thought it would be
a cool idea, because I remember being fascinated by and attempting to play Core
Wars as a kid. I'm all grown up now, but I still can't be bothered to actually
write Redcode, so I'm setting this up so that I can evolve programs that compete
against each other in a kind of natural selection kind of a situation.
