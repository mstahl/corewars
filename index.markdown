Hi everybody!

I decided to write a bunch of Corewars-related tools and package them up for a
gem, for literally no other reason than that I was bored one weekend. That is
all.

## Why Corewars?

I've been doing a lot of fidgeting about with evolutionary computing, genetic
programming, etc., and Corewars seemed like an ideal game to evolve players
for, since the structure of Redcode programs is so simple.

## Status

I'm actively developing this, so it's not really in a state where it can be 
used for anything at the moment. I will be posting updates and a full status
page is coming soon.
